    "After fitting two models it has become apparent that untuned models are much better at identifying consents than non-consents. Tuning models with a weighting hyperparameter for non-consents and optimising for balanced accuracy reverses this, the recall for non-consents is much higher than the recall for consents in tuned models. This trade off is undesirable as useful models should be good at identifying both consents and non-consents.<br> \n",
    "The untuned models over estimate the consent rate, and the tuned models under estimate the consent rate. So all models ar relying on over estimation of one class to correctly identify members of that class, no model has improved the ability of the model to correctly classify both classes.<br>\n",
    "The untuned models over estimate consent, this is because of the wish variable in the dataset. This variable shows the potential donor's prior decisio to donate. The highest odds ratio in logistic regression model for any variable is the variable representing patients who have previously expressed a wish to donate, and intuitivly people who have expressed a wish to donate organs are more likely to donate organs.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook a random forest will be fit to datasets without the wish variable in an attempt to create a model that is more balanced in its ability to  predict consents and non-consents.\n",
